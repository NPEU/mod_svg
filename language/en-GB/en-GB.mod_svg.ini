It gets loaded into an article or using {loadposition svg} where 'svg' is the name of the new module position you define when saving this moduele. (Note it's fine to leave it as 'svg').</p>
<p>SVG has the potential to contain <strong>harmful code</strong> - you need to know what you're doing.</p>
<p>This SVG module should be used for 'real' infographics and needs to be properly accessible, meaning the description should be embedded in this markup using proper tags (more help on this coming soon.)</p>"
<p>Note that it's possible to include a description of the infographic in the text surrounding where this SVG appears but including it in the SVG itself could make it more portable.</p>"

<p>Care needs to be taken using <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> tags - fonts are an issue, as is the source-order (which equates to reading order for screen readers. It's possible that you may way to outline the text and just use a description for the whole thing instead.</p>
<p>SVG's need to be properly tested and optimised. More on this another time.</p>"
